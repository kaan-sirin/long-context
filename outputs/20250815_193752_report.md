## Key Insights

- The process of building a digital automation agency involves three main services: developing internal systems, selling direct automation to clients, and establishing a Software as a Service (SaaS) company.
- The agency should initially focus on one of these three paths to ensure a more structured and manageable start.
- Developing internal systems involves automating processes within a company, such as creating product visuals for a furniture company.
- The process involves creating an internal system for a company to automate their product image creation.
- A simple application is developed to replace a manual system with an automated one, specifically for a furniture company.
- The system allows customers to upload furniture images, change backgrounds, and convert them into videos.
- The initial setup cost for the system is between $2000 to $5000, with a maintenance fee of $150 to $200.
- The system uses Bold for development and integrates with Falaya for AI capabilities, with Superbase running in the background.
- The process involves building simple systems with minimal issues to function as a digital automation agency.
- Superbase is used in the background for some systems, although it is not always necessary.
- Bolt Lovable and Fall AI are mentioned as tools that are sufficient for building simple systems.
- The second phase involves directly selling automation to clients, using tools like Bolt and N8 for interface development.
- The process begins with developing a software system that allows users to create product visuals, which can be set up in about an hour.
- The system is marketed to textile brands through email marketing, offering them free credits to encourage usage and eventual payment.
- The initial step involves developing internal systems and small applications for companies to generate initial revenue.
- Learning and implementing automation using N8 templates is crucial in the early stages.
- The second stage involves creating more complex automations as experience grows.
- The final stage is establishing a software company, which is considered the 'final boss' and should be approached after gaining sufficient experience and handling initial free users.
- The process involves initially focusing on system development as a healthier approach.
- The use of 'Çeçipiti' (likely a tool or platform) to evaluate and determine the steps to follow.
- The mention of using 'Bolt' and 'N8N' as part of the process, though their specific roles are not detailed.
- The strategy includes developing internal systems for brands and selling them as an agency.
- The process begins with creating a free Apollo account, which is used for filtering and gathering potential client data.
- Filters are applied in Apollo to target specific locations (e.g., United States, Germany, Europe) and industries (e.g., Fashion, Textiles).
- Employee size filters are set to 11-20, 21-50, and 51-100 to target companies that are not too small or too large.
- Job titles related to marketing are added to the filters to identify relevant contacts within companies.
- A setting is used to limit the selection to one contact per company to avoid redundancy.
- Fiverr can be used to outsource the task of filtering and data collection if needed.
- The process begins with extracting a list of potential clients interested in marketing, specifically targeting medium-sized companies in the US and Europe with 11 to 100 employees.
- The URL of the list is taken to Fiverr to hire someone for Apollo List Extraction, which is an optional step as the list can also be extracted directly from Apollo.
- While the list is being extracted on Fiverr, the next step involves purchasing a domain for the agency, which can be done through GoDaddy.
- A simple website can be created for the agency using platforms like Bolt, although it's not essential at the start.
- The third step is preparing for outreach, which involves acquiring multiple domains (e.g., .co, .com) to avoid spam issues when sending out mass emails.
- To build an agency, it is necessary to purchase multiple domains under the agency's or company's name to avoid emails being marked as spam.
- Create multiple email addresses using different domains to send emails within limits, such as 100 emails per address.
- Set up a system where all emails from different addresses (e.g., emily@company.co, sara@company.co, john@company.co) are redirected to a main email address (e.g., esat@company.com) for easier management of positive responses.
- Purchase domains from providers like GoDaddy and set up Google Business accounts for these domains.
- In Turkey, setting up these email addresses is cheaper compared to Europe.
- Begin by setting up 3 domains and 3 email addresses, allowing for a total of 9 different emails to be used for outreach.
- Send hundreds of emails from each address weekly to reach a large audience.
- To avoid emails being marked as spam, it's crucial to 'warm up' the emails using a tool like Instantly.
- The warming process involves creating internal email traffic to make the email appear secure and trustworthy to systems like Google.
- The warming process typically takes between 10 to 14 days, and the effectiveness is measured by the health score of the email.
- A high health score indicates that the email is ready for outreach without being flagged as spam.
- The final step involves preparing for customer demos and sales once the emails are warmed up.
- The process begins with acquiring pre-warmed email accounts or creating your own to maintain control and reduce costs.
- Emails are written without links initially to avoid being marked as spam.
- Apollo lists are used to gather potential client contacts, which can be sourced through freelancers on platforms like Fiverr.
- The outreach process involves writing a three-stage email sequence without links, with the possibility of adding a meeting link in the third email.
- Instagram campaigns are suggested as an additional method for outreach.
- The process begins with focusing on internal system development rather than automation and software companies.
- The initial pricing strategy involves charging $2500 per project and $150-200 monthly for maintenance, with the possibility of offering lower prices to secure the first client.
- For textile clients, a product image service is offered, which involves setting up a specialized product image system.
- Apollo is used to find a customer list, which is then outsourced to someone on Fiverr for cost efficiency.
- Domains are purchased and prepared for outreach, with Instantly used to warm up emails.
- A waiting period of approximately two weeks is planned to allow for email warming and list preparation.
- After two weeks, the list from Fiverr is added to Instantly, and emails are ready for outreach.
- The process includes showing the list addition and initial client email outreach, followed by a one-week wait for client responses.
- The next steps involve preparing and sending demos based on client responses.
- The process begins with determining the idea and preparing for the first client engagement.
- A list of potential clients is generated using Apollo, and the URL is used to create a lead generation task on Fiverr.
- To avoid purchasing a premium account on Apollo, a technique is used to generate a list more cheaply, which is suitable for one-time tests.
- Emails are entered into Instantly for warming up, which involves checking the health scores of the emails to ensure they are above 95%.
- Domains are purchased and different domains are used for outreach preparation.
- The final steps involve reaching out to clients and handling sales, which are planned for the last part of the process.
- The process involves checking health scores, which should be above 95%.
- Campaign requests are sourced from Fiverr and Apollo.
- The campaign section involves setting up email sequences, starting with a 'reach out' email followed by a 'quick chat' email.
- The call-to-action in emails is to offer a free custom demo instead of scheduling a meeting.
- The goal is to secure at least one customer, focusing on scalability and simplicity.

- The process begins with identifying potential clients and gathering their information while respecting their privacy.
- The next step involves creating an application using 'Bolt' and 'Falla'.
- A presentation is prepared for the client, which may include a pricing visual similar to those used in the past with 'R-spot'.
- The application is tailored to the client's needs, specifically in the textile industry, allowing them to visualize their models wearing specific clothing items.
- The process begins with deciding on a specific field, in this case, the textile industry, and creating a system tailored to that field.
- The first step involves using a platform called 'Falaya' to determine which AI models can be used for the project.
- The project involves creating a 'try on' application for clothing, specifically t-shirts, where users can select a model and a t-shirt to see how it looks on the model.
- The process includes finding images of t-shirts and models online to test different models and decide which one to use.
- The 'Falaya' platform is used to test different 'try on' applications, such as 'Lefa' and 'Fashion try on', to determine which provides the best quality.
- The 'Kling' application is specifically mentioned as being difficult to use, but it is tested first by uploading images of the model and the t-shirt.
- The cost of using the 'Kling' application is noted as 7 cents per use.
- The process involves testing different models to determine which one is best suited for the agency's needs.
- Kling is identified as a preferred product due to its performance and cost-effectiveness.
- The process includes using an automatic clothing type detection feature, which is likely a part of Kling's functionality.
- API integration is a part of the process, with instructions to copy the necessary APIs for further use.

- The process involves creating a price offer using Canva, specifically utilizing a price template for customization.
- The focus is on directing clients towards a premium plan, particularly emphasizing the middle price option.
- Video generation is highlighted as a crucial component of the service offering.
- A login plus saving logic system is proposed, which requires setting up a database.
- The pricing strategy includes offering a monthly maintenance fee, initially suggested at $100, but reduced to $49 to increase client engagement.
- The approach involves not charging a maintenance fee initially to attract clients, even though it is generally recommended to charge for it.
- The process begins with creating a list of potential customers and sending out emails to them.
- Upon receiving a positive response from a potential customer, a demo and pricing are prepared and sent to the customer.
- If the customer is interested, a meeting is scheduled to discuss further details.
- The agency focuses on digital automation, specifically targeting brands in the textile sector.
- Tools like Apollo are used to generate lists of potential clients.
